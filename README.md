This package will delete old files from directories. You can use a configuration file to specify the maximum age of a file in a certain directory.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require spatie/laravel-directory-cleanup
```

In Laravel 5.5 the service provider will automatically get registered. In older versions of the framework just add the service provider in `config/app.php` file:

```php
'providers' => [
    ...
    Spatie\DirectoryCleanup\DirectoryCleanupServiceProvider::class,

];
```
Next, you must publish the config file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\DirectoryCleanup\DirectoryCleanupServiceProvider"
```
This is the content of the published config file `laravel-directory-cleanup`
```
return [

    /*
     * A policy will determine if a given file should be deleted. This is the perfect
     * place to apply custom rules (like only deleting files with a certain extension).
     * A valid policy is any class that extends `Spatie\DirectoryCleanup\Policies\Policy`
     */
    'cleanup_policy' => \Spatie\DirectoryCleanup\Policies\Basic::class,

    'directories' => [
        
        /**
         * Here you can specify which directories need to be cleanup. All files older than
         * the specified amount of minutes will be deleted.
         */

        /*
        'path/to/a/directory' => [
            'deleteAllOlderThanMinutes' => 60 * 24
        ],
        */
    ],
];
```

## Usage

Specify the directories that need cleaning in the config file.

When running the console command `clean:directories` all files in the specified directories older then `deleteAllOlderThanMinutes` will be deleted.

This command can be scheduled in Laravel's console kernel.

```php
// app/Console/Kernel.php

protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
   $schedule->command('clean:directories')->daily();
}

```

If you want to apply additional conditional logic before a file is deleted, you can replace the default `cleanup_policy` with a custom one.
Create a class which extends `Spatie\DirectoryCleanup\Policies\Policy` and add your logic to the `allow` method. Make sure to return `true` if the file should be deleted.

```php
// app/CleanupPolicies/MyPolicy.php

namespace App\CleanupPolicies;

use Symfony\Component\Finder\SplFileInfo;
use Spatie\DirectoryCleanup\Policies\Policy;

class MyPolicy extends Policy
{
    public function allow(SplFileInfo $file) : bool
    {
        $filesToKeep = ['robots.txt'];

        return ! in_array($file->getFilename(), $filesToKeep);
    }
}
```
