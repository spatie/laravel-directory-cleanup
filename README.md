This package will delete old files from directories. You can use a configuration file to specify the maximum age of a file in a certain directory.

Spatie is a webdesign agency based in Antwerp, Belgium. You'll find an overview of all our open source projects [on our website](https://spatie.be/opensource).

## Postcardware

You're free to use this package (it's [MIT-licensed](LICENSE.md)), but if it makes it to your production environment you are required to send us a postcard from your hometown, mentioning which of our package(s) you are using.

Our address is: Spatie, Samberstraat 69D, 2060 Antwerp, Belgium.

The best postcards will get published on the open source page on our website.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require spatie/laravel-directory-cleanup
```

Next up, the service provider must be registered:

```php
'providers' => [
    ...
    Spatie\DirectoryCleanup\DirectoryCleanupServiceProvider::class,

];
```
Next, you must publish the config file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\DirectoryCleanup\DirectoryCleanupServiceProvider"
```
This is the content of the published config file `laravel-directory-cleanup`
```
return [

    'directories' => [
        
        /**
         * Here you can specify which directories need to be cleanup. All files older than
         * the specified amount of minutes will be deleted.
         */

        /*
        'path/to/a/directory' => [
            'deleteAllOlderThanMinutes' => 60 * 24,
            'deleteAllWithPrefix' => 'prefix-'
        ],
        */
    ],
];
```

## Usage

Specify the directories that need cleaning in the config file.

When running the console command `clean:directories` all files in the specified directories older then `deleteAllOlderThanMinutes` will be deleted.

This command can be scheduled in Laravel's console kernel.

```php
// app/Console/Kernel.php

protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
   $schedule->command('clean:directories')->daily();
}

```
